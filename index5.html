        <p>Without you, life's a lonely fate,<br>
            Endless days, a daunting weight.<br>
            No hand to hold, no love to find,<br>
            In darkness, I'd be left behind.</p>
            
            <p>But with you, my dear, the world transforms,<br>
            Loneliness fades, replaced by warm norms.<br>
            Days are painted with laughter and light,<br>
            Your love, a beacon in my darkest night.</p>
            
            <p>Your presence, a melody of grace,<br>
            Every shared moment, a tender embrace.<br>
            Together, we conquer the challenges we face,<br>
            In the race of life, we find our pace.</p>
            
            <p>Without you, a path unknown and bare,<br>
            With you, life's burdens become easier to bear.<br>
            My heart sings with joy, in love we ensue,<br>
            Life is brighter, truer, with you.</p>

            A source of joy that traveled from afar.<br>
            My pain, you shouldered, a burden you bore,<br>
            A love so deep, like none before.</p>
            
            <p>With your smile, life gained a new hue,<br>
            Making each day worthwhile, shared with you.<br>

        <p>Before you entered my existence,<br>
            all was shrouded in darkness and despair.<br>
            My life lacked the grace of clouds and sunlight,<br>
            as well as the beauty of stars in the night air.</p>
            
            <p>I never held faith in enchantment,<br>
            yet you materialized, a wondrous sight.<br>
            I once anticipated a solitary journey,<br>
            but now, together, we form a perfect light.</p>
            
            <p>You shape the essence of my being,<br>
            sculpting me in every conceivable way.<br>
            Each moment is precious, a testament,<br>
            as I willingly dedicate my entire day.</p>
            
            <p>Our connection is intense,<br>
            a fierce flame for all to witness.<br>
            The emotions exchanged between us,<br>
            a reciprocity of love, profound and limitless.</p>

            Calm, happiness, euphoria, and joy.</p>
            
            <p>In your love, I discover<br>
            Sensations of safety, steadiness,<br>
            and emotional assurance.</p>
